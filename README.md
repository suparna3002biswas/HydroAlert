Due to space constraint, the file containing weights of the deep learning model could not be loaded.
To get that run this Google Colab file- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tuKPxth7BcJw75bupI6_Qv1EX00mc0Bb?usp=sharing

To run this file, generate a Kaggle API key of yours from Kaggle and upload it while running the Google Colab file. After the entire file has been ran successfully
download the weights file that is available. The extension of the file is .keras. Put the file in the root folder.
